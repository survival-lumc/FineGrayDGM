## Abstract

Studies considering competing risks will often aim to estimate the
cumulative incidence functions conditional on an individual’s baseline
characteristics. While the Fine–Gray subdistribution hazard model is
tailor-made for analysing only one of the competing events, it may still
be used in settings where multiple competing events are of scientific
interest, where it is specified for each cause in turn. In this work, we
provide an overview of data-generating mechanisms where proportional
subdistribution hazards hold for at least one cause. We use these to
motivate why the use of multiple Fine-Gray models should be reconsidered
in favour of better alternatives.
